/*
*Sometimes a type cannot be constructor-injected. This can happen for multiple reasons.
*  For example, One cannot constructor-inject an interface. One  also cannot
* constructor-inject a type that one do not own, such as a class from an external library.
*  In these cases, Hilt must to be provided with information how to create these objects.
*
A Hilt module is a class that is annotated with @Module. Like a Dagger module, it
* informs Hilt how to provide instances of certain types. Unlike Dagger modules,
* one must annotate Hilt modules with @InstallIn to tell Hilt which Android class
* each module will be used or installed in.
*
* SingletonComponent are app level dependencises and exist as long as the app is alive.
