/*Base application class is a requirement for hilt to work it must
* be annotated with HiltAndroidApp
*
* @HiltAndroidApp triggers Hilt's code generation, including a base class for the application
* that serves as the application-level dependency container.
*
* Unlike dagger 2 hilt does this by iteself and dosent require any effort on developer's part,
* In dagger 2, One has to build the application class, initilize dagger 2,
* Build the appcompnets, build modules for the components, Use the builder or factory pattern
* to build the components. Save the refrence fo componets in the application class. Rebuild the
* project. which then just initilizes dagger 2.
*
*
* None of  this is required in Hilt which does it all behind the scenes, it also removes all
*  the boilerplate code one has to write , just to setup dagger 2  as explained above.
